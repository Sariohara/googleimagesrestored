### Overview

This extension attempts to make Google Images look and feel like it did before they changed everything on August 6th, 2019.

This extension also re-adds the 'View Image' button that was removed at some point. It also removes those 'related searches' divs that are scattered throughout the image results, a nuisance 'feature' introduced in mid 2019.
