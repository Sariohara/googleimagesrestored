### Overview

This extension attempts to make Google Images look and feel like it did before they changed everything on August 6th.

I didn't have a copy of the exact html/css of the old layout, so this is a rough eyeball attempt at recreating the old design and functionality from scratch. It isn't perfect, and I'm trying to fix some quirks when I can.

This extension also re-adds the 'View Image' button that was removed at some point. It also removes those 'related searches' divs that are scattered throughout the image results, a nuisance 'feature' introduced in mid 2019.

Also, this extension now re-adds the 'Exact Size..' feature that was removed in late August 2019.

Unfortunately I don't know how long this extension will stay working, as Google may change even more things causing some stuff to break. For now it works okay.
