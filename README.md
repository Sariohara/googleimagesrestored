Google Images Restored

This extension attempts to make Google Images look and feel like it did before they changed everything on August 6th.

I didn't have a copy of the exact html/css of the old layout, so this is a rough eyeball attempt at recreating the old design and functionality from scratch. It isn't perfect, and there are some quirks I'd like to fix. But for now it's at least something.

This extension also re-adds the 'View Image' button that was removed at some point. It also removes those 'related searches' divs that are scattered throughout the image results, a nuisance 'feature' introduced in mid 2019.

Unfortunately I don't know how long this extension will stay working, as Google may change even more things causing some stuff to break. For now it works okay.
